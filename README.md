# JS Library

A library built using only HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. This project uses objects, where each book is constructed using the same prototype, and more DOM Manipulation to display them. The library loads with 5 books already, each with a title, author, number of pages, and completion status. Each book has a delete button that removes it from the library, and a change status button that changes the completion status of each individual book. Users can use the form at the bottom of the library to add more books.
